       <li>Makkah Masjid, is one of the most established mosques in Hyderabad, Telangana in India, and it is one of the biggest masajids in India</li>
	   <li>Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth leader of the Qutb Shahi tradition, ordered bricks to be produced using the dirt brought from Mecca, the holiest site of Islam, and utilized them as a part of the development of the focal curve of the mosque, in this manner giving the mosque its name</li>
       <li>The primary lobby of the mosque is 75 feet high, 220 feet wide and 180 feet, sufficiently long to suit 10,000 admirers at once. Fifteen curves bolster the top of the principle lobby, five on each of the three sides. A divider ascents on the fourth side to give Mihrab.</li>

       <li>At the crest of the minarets flanking the mosque is an angled exhibition, or more that a smallish arch and a tower. Engravings from the Qur'an enhance a number of the curves and entryways.</li>
       <li> The passage yard it is best of the mosque, a rectangular, angled and canopied building houses the marble graves of Asaf Jahi rulers.</li>
	   <li> On the four sides of the rooftop on the primary mosque, the bulwarks are made of rock boards fit as a fiddle of transformed conches roosted on platforms. From the cornice of the mosque, its minarets are not as high as the minarets on the mazaar (Nizams tombs) sanctuary from their cornice</li>
