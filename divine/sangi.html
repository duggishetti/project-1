       <li>Sanghi Temple, situated at Sanghi Nagar in Telangana in India, is around 35 km from Hyderabad city. The holy Raja Gopuram, which is exceptionally tall, can be seen from a few kilometers away.</li>
	   <li> It started with a fantasy. The irrepressible inclination to make something genuinely divine. What's more, the Sanghi family, surely understood for its kind and beneficent quality took upon itself to make this fantasy a reality.</li>
	   <li> To guarantee that only the best went into the venture, the Sanghis held the administrations of Shri Ganapathy Sthapathy, the eminent sculptor.</li>
       <li>He surrendered to the post of  principal of the School of Architecture and Sculpture after the demise of his dad, who had served as essential of the School of Architecture and Sculpture at Mamallapuram from 1957 to 1960.</li>
